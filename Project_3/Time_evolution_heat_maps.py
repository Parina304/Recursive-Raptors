"""Temperature Profile Heatmap Generator

This script reads a specially-formatted CSV file containing temperature profiles 
along a robotâ€™s height measured over time. The file is divided into blocks 
separated by empty lines, where each block corresponds to a height `z` on the robot.

Each block:
- Contains time and multiple temperature sensor readings.
- Is processed to average temperature readings across sensors.
- Is stored in a dictionary mapping height `z` to (time, averaged temperatures).

Finally, the script constructs a temperature matrix and visualizes it as a 
heatmap showing the temperature evolution along the robot's height over a 
7-hour period.
